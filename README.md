secretary form to track minutes from Toastmasters Meeting
this is a template that runs off of Angular 1 with simple data binding to ease the filling out of the form
this is mobile friendly to use and fill out at a Toastmaster's Meeting
the index.php file creates the .txt file on the server
I setup a macro on Microsoft Word to format it to send it attached to an email cause that is how my club likes the minutes
you could totally setup a cron job to send a responsive email instead

# toastmastersSecretary
secretary form to track minutes from Toastmasters Meeting
this is a template that runs off of Angular 1 with simple data binding to ease the filling out of the form
this is mobile friendly to use and fill out at a Toastmaster's Meeting
I need to get the server script finished to write to a file and send the email to the members via a chron job
probably will end up just using php
